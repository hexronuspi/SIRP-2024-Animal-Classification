### Project Details
#### IP0NB0000018 - ML for sustainability: Satellite Data Processing for Detecting Pollution Sources using Computer Vision 

#### Faculty Advisor: Nipun Batra

The Code report is available in .pdf format <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XtJzis_dHHLyPbMDrgBTfjLd3qEJwOFc/view?usp=sharing">here</a>.
## Kaggle 
The code was originally run on kaggle and it took around `220 minutes for a complete run` adhering to the requirments of the selection task for SIRP 2024. The link for kaggle run and output at one place is <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/code/hexronus/ml-sirp-2024">Link</a>.

## Drive
The Output Loss and Accuracy Curve Images and .txt file containing the Data generated during the process are stored as .zip in the Google Drive. Link for Google Drive is <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zFaw7Lu64HEMIjBv_IF22twt7sPsHEHq/view?usp=sharing">here</a>. This has data only for one-vs-rest as that was very big to see in the kaggle output, and 5 class classification generated data can be seen in the kaggle output.
### Folder Structure

**Note:**

- `data`: Contains plots of curves for 3 fold Cross-Validation and 3 epochs.
- `data-value`: A .txt file containing the loss and accuracy values and confusion matrix.
